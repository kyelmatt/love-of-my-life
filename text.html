    Love is something I have always sought throughout my college life, and I have consistently been the one looking for it. I always stand with "mahal ko" instead of "mahal ako," not until you came into my life.
    
    For years, I have been single, mingling with multiple girls, breaking my heart several times. Yet, I learned a lot from those experiences. You, Genelle, are an exception.
    
    Over the past five months, I have constantly been learning new things about academics, life, and specially about you. I enjoy the non-stop talk shows, rants, sudden burst of emotions, and everything that we do together. I just enjoy being with you and would love to be involved in your everyday life even more.  
    
    If I were to be honest with you, I thought I would fall out of love and break your heart. Talking about academics isn't inherently romantic, yet I enjoy the time we spend together, stressing over our academics, and I would love to do it with you over and over again. As I've said before, Nelle, I can learn how to love a person. During the holiday break, we were able to get to know each other deeply, say the things we couldn't say before, and so it happened. I had fallen.
    
    You are the very first lover I've had in a long time. I love you so much for appreciating me and for always making me feel loved.
    
    Genelle, I want us to start this new year with a new phase. Remember that I promised you a label, a label that would officially make us partners. With that, I want to give you my utmost love, loyalty, appreciation, care, and all the positive adjectives you can think of.`;
